## Project Requirements

- **Allowed Editors**: You can use either `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` as your code editor for this project.

- **Compilation Environment**: Your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`. The compiler should be invoked with the following options:
   - `-Wall`: Enable most warning messages.
   - `-Werror`: Treat warnings as errors, which means your code should be warning-free to compile successfully.
   - `-Wextra`: Enable additional warning messages.
   - `-pedantic`: Enforce strict ISO C standard compliance.
   - `-std=gnu89`: Use the GNU C89 standard.

- **New Line at the End of Files**: Every file you create should end with a new line character.

- **README.md File**: You must include a `README.md` file at the root of your project folder. This README file typically contains information about your project, how to compile and run it, and any other relevant information.

- **Coding Style**: Your code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`. The Betty style is a set of coding style guidelines that helps maintain consistency in code formatting.

- **Global Variables**: You are not allowed to use global variables in your code.

- **Function Limit**: Each source code file should contain no more than 5 functions. This encourages writing modular and maintainable code.

- **Standard Library**: You are not allowed to use functions from the standard library like `printf`, `puts`, etc. This suggests that you'll need to write your own versions of these functions if necessary.

- **Use of _putchar**: You are allowed to use a function called `_putchar`.

- **Do Not Push _putchar.c**: You don't need to include your own `_putchar.c` file in your repository. The project will provide its own `_putchar` implementation.

- **Header File**: You should create a header file named `main.h`. This header file should contain prototypes for all your functions, including `_putchar`.

- **Push Your Header File**: Don't forget to add and push your `main.h` header file to your repository.

These guidelines are meant to ensure that your code is of high quality, easy to maintain, and consistent with the project's requirements. Make sure to follow them closely when working on your project.
